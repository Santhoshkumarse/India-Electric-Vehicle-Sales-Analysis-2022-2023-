# India Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis (2022-2023) (Interactive Dashboard creation using Tableau)
## Objective
The objective of the Electric Vehicle Sales Dashboard is to analyze EV sales trends, compare year-on-year growth, identify top manufacturers, and highlight seasonal performance. It provides insights by segmenting two- and four-wheelers and allows filtering by year, maker, category, and month for customized analysis.

## Process 
Here is the process for analyzing and deriving insights using the three dashboards:
Data Collection and Preparation:
<br>
•	Gather data on EV sales, charging station distribution, and government incentives from reliable sources.
<br>
•	Clean, preprocess, and structure the data for consistency and accurate analysis.
<br>
<br>
Dashboard Design:
<br>
•	Create intuitive visualizations for KPIs, trends, and comparisons.
<br>
•	Segment data into meaningful categories like sales (two-wheelers, four-wheelers), infrastructure (charging stations), and incentives (state-wise distribution).
<br>
<br>
Analysis by Dashboard:
<br>
Electric Vehicle Sales Dashboard:
<br>
•	Analyze year-on-year sales growth.
<br>
•	Identify top-performing manufacturers and seasonal trends.
<br>
