# India Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis (2022-2023) (Interactive Dashboard creation using Tableau)
## Objective
The objective of the Electric Vehicle Sales Dashboard is to analyze EV sales trends, compare year-on-year growth, identify top manufacturers, and highlight seasonal performance. It provides insights by segmenting two- and four-wheelers and allows filtering by year, maker, category, and month for customized analysis.
